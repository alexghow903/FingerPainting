# Overview

The game is not done yet, but in theory there will be a canvas that you can finger paint on in Vr with integrated hand tracking.

This was a test to see if I could work with both unity and oculus integreation and a more difficult controller on the first try.

# Development Environment

I used unity with the oculus integration package to develop for the oculus quest 2.

# Future Work

* Canvas needs to work.
* Colors need to be selectable and attach to hand.
